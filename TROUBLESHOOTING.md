# 🔧 Troubleshooting: "Show me my latest campaign" 

## ✅ ISSUE IDENTIFIED

The `cakemail_get_latest_campaign` tool has been successfully implemented and built, but Claude Desktop may not have picked up the new tool yet.

## 🚀 SOLUTION

### **Step 1: Restart Claude Desktop**
1. **Quit Claude Desktop completely** (Cmd+Q on Mac, or close from system tray)
2. **Wait 5 seconds**
3. **Restart Claude Desktop**
4. **Wait for it to fully load**

### **Step 2: Test the New Tool**
Try these commands:
```
"Show me my latest campaign"
"Get my latest campaign"  
"What's my latest campaign?"
"Show my most recent campaign"
```

### **Step 3: Test with Parameters**
```
"Show me my latest campaign with analytics"
"Get my latest sent campaign" 
"Show me my latest draft campaign"
```

## 🔍 VERIFICATION

### **Check Available Tools**
If the restart doesn't work, you can verify the tools are loaded by asking:
```
"What Cakemail tools do you have available?"
```

You should see `cakemail_get_latest_campaign` in the list.

### **Build Status**
The server has been built successfully:
- ✅ Version: 1.2.0
- ✅ Tool: `cakemail_get_latest_campaign` implemented
- ✅ Build files: Current and updated
- ✅ Handler: Properly configured

## 🛠 MANUAL BUILD (If Needed)

If the tool still doesn't work after restart, manually rebuild:

```bash
cd /Users/francoislane/dev/cakemail-mcp-server
npm run rebuild
```

Then restart Claude Desktop again.

## 📋 EXPECTED RESPONSE

When working, you should see a response like:

```
🎯 **Latest Campaign**

**Raw Data:**

```

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE

The most common reason for "Show me my latest campaign" not working is that Claude Desktop hasn't restarted since the new tool was added. MCP tools are loaded when Claude Desktop starts, so new tools require a restart.

## ✅ NEXT STEPS

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** (most likely fix)
2. **Test the command**: "Show me my latest campaign"
3. **If it works**: You're all set! 🎉
4. **If it doesn't work**: Try the manual build and restart again

**The tool is implemented correctly - it just needs Claude Desktop to restart to recognize it!** 🚀
