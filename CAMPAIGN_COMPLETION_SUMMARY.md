### API Coverage Analysis
Before this implementation:
```
Coverage: 35.3% (6/17 endpoints)
Missing: 11 critical endpoints
```

After this implementation:
```
Coverage: 100% (17/17 endpoints) âœ…
Missing: 0 endpoints âœ…
```

## Usage Examples

### Schedule a Campaign
```
cakemail_schedule_campaign
  campaign_id: "12345"
  scheduled_for: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
```

cakemail_send_test_email
  campaign_id: "12345"
  emails: ["test@example.com", "team@example.com"]
```

### Preview Campaign
```
cakemail_render_campaign
  campaign_id: "12345"
  contact_id: 67890  # Optional for personalization
```

### Manage Campaign State
```
