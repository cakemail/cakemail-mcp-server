filter: "type==click;type==open;type==view"

// Critical issues - hard bounces and spam
filter: "type==bounce_hb;type==spam;type==bounce_mb"

// Temporary failures - soft bounces and DNS issues  
filter: "type==bounce_sb;type==bounce_df;type==bounce_fm"

// List management - subscription changes
filter: "type==subscribe;type==unsubscribe;type==global_unsubscribe"
```

#### **Event Type Categories**
- **ENGAGEMENT**: click, open, view, forward, share (user interactions)
- **BOUNCES**: bounce_hb (hard), bounce_sb (soft), bounce_mb (blocked), bounce_df (DNS), bounce_fm (full mailbox), bounce_tr (transient)
- **LIST_MANAGEMENT**: subscribe, unsubscribe, global_unsubscribe (list changes)
- **DELIVERABILITY_ISSUES**: spam, auto_responder (reputation threats)
- **DELIVERY_PIPELINE**: generating, in_queue, sent, received, skipped (processing status)

### üîÑ Backward Compatibility

- **Enhanced existing tools**: Campaign and analytics tools now have richer log data available
- **Same configuration**: No changes to environment variables or setup required
