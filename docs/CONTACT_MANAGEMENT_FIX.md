# Contact Management Tools Implementation Summary

## Issue Fixed
The `ContactApi` class had full CRUD operations for contact management, but there were no corresponding MCP tools or handlers to expose this functionality through the MCP interface.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created Contact Tools Configuration (`src/config/contact-tools.ts`)
Added 10 comprehensive contact management tools:
- `cakemail_list_contacts` - List all contacts with pagination and filtering
- `cakemail_create_contact` - Create a new contact in a list
- `cakemail_get_contact` - Get details of a specific contact
- `cakemail_update_contact` - Update an existing contact
- `cakemail_delete_contact` - Delete a contact (permanent action)
- `cakemail_unsubscribe_contact` - Unsubscribe a contact from a list
- `cakemail_import_contacts` - Import multiple contacts to a list
- `cakemail_tag_contacts` - Add tags to multiple contacts
- `cakemail_untag_contacts` - Remove tags from multiple contacts
- `cakemail_search_contacts` - Search contacts with advanced filtering

### 2. Created Contact Handlers (`src/handlers/contacts.ts`)
Implemented all 10 handler functions with:
- Comprehensive error handling using `handleCakemailError`
- Input validation for required fields
- Rich formatted responses with emojis and clear structure
- Support for pagination, filtering, and sorting
- Account ID scoping for multi-tenant support
- Detailed operation summaries and feedback

### 3. Updated Handler Registry (`src/handlers/index.ts`)
- Imported all contact handler functions
- Registered all 10 contact handlers in the `handlerRegistry`
- Maintains consistent naming convention with other handlers

### 4. Updated Tools Configuration (`src/config/tools.ts`)
- Imported `contactTools` from the new configuration file
- Added contact tools to the `allTools` array
- Exported `contactTools` for external access

## Features Implemented

### Contact CRUD Operations
- **List Contacts**: Filter by list, email, status with pagination
- **Create Contact**: Add new contacts with custom fields
- **Get Contact**: Retrieve full contact details including tags and custom fields
- **Update Contact**: Modify contact information
- **Delete Contact**: Permanently remove contacts

### Bulk Operations
- **Import Contacts**: Batch import multiple contacts with error tracking
- **Tag/Untag Contacts**: Bulk tag management for contact organization

### Advanced Features
- **Search Contacts**: Advanced search with multiple filter options
- **Unsubscribe**: Manage contact subscription status
- **Custom Fields**: Full support for custom field management
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Account ID scoping throughout

## Testing
Created `test-contact-handlers.js` to verify the implementation works correctly with the actual Cakemail API.

## Result
Users can now fully manage individual contacts through the MCP interface, enabling complete email list management capabilities including:
- Contact lifecycle management (create, read, update, delete)
- Bulk operations for efficient list management
- Advanced search and filtering
- Tag-based organization
- Custom field support
- Full integration with existing list management tools
